Soccer Coach Helper

Problem:
----------------------

I am a coach and I would like tools to improve my coaching abilities.

----------------------

Solution:
----------------------

An app that will help me keep track of substitutions, drills, field clipboard, and anything else I can think of.

----------------------

Sub Tracker:
----------------------

Will require us to put in all of the player names that are playing as well as their position. To sub players in from the bench, select their name and select the position they are going to. The person in that position will then be out. The players on the field should display their current position, as well as the amount of time they have been on the pitch.

----------------------

Workflow:
----------------------

Select a team, create team screen, along with instructions.

Once a team is selected or created, a menu shows (splash page) with options to Manage Team, Substitution Manager, Half Time Board, Drills List. 

All of these pages will have the top navigation.

Manage Team – Allow to add and remove players from team

Substitution Manager – Set the start time of the game. Display a list of players and allow the user to drag them to their correct position. Once changes are made, you can click Save or Start Half. Once start half is selected, then an End Half button is displayed. After that is selected, Start Half then appears again. After that button is pressed, then End Game is displayed. To make a sub, you can simple drag a player from the bench over to a player on the field. This will switch the player on the field to the player on the bench. You can also drag players on the field over another player on the field, which will switch their positions. The app will keep track of the last time the player was put on the bench.
